# NASA Space Apps Challenge 2019
This repo contains work for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2019 Hackathon. The project we built was an interactive web game that aims to raise people's awareness on how their actions can have impacts on our planet. The game works by having the user upload pictures of a food they have eaten and using image recognition artifical intelligence, the planet inside the game environment changes. For example, if a person uploads images of steak, the number of cows in the planet will decrease.
